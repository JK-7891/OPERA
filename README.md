# OPERA
OPERA is a free and open-source/open-data suite of QSAR models providing predictions on physicochemical properties, environmental fate and toxcicity endpoints as well as additional information including applicability domain and accuracy assessment. All models were built on curated data and standardized QSAR-ready chemical structures. OPERA is available for Windows and Linux operating systems. It can be installed as a standalone desktop application or embedded in a different tool/workflow.
