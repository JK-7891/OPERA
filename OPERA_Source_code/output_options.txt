By default, the output file(s) will contain the predictions, applicability domain and accuracy assessment in csv or txt format.

The default fields are: Molecule ID, predicted value (pred), Applicability domain (AD), Similarity index (Sim_index) and accuracy estimate (Conf_index).

Additional options:

    Separate files:          Separate output file for each endpoint. Recommended if high number of molecules are predicted.
	
    Nearest neighbors:       Includes the (3 or 5) nearest neighbors from training set (CAS, InCHiKeys, Observed and predicted values).
	
    Descriptors values:      Output file containing all prediction details and used descriptors (only if output is in csv format).
	
    Descriptors files:       Keep temporary descriptors files (generated during descriptor calculation).
